            //of the beacon and push the correct button, after pushing the button we park and start moving are arm. The arm will move most of the way out
            //with the turn table spinning then the arm will move out more then dump are climbers in to the goal then is right behind the color beacon.

            //to start to phase down the speed as we move closer to are target so we dont jerk around as much and maybe cause damage to the robot.
            //Another thing you might see is at the end of the move forward we then drive back a bit before turning, the reason for this is so that
